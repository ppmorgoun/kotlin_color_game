# Kotlin Coloring game
A simple coloring in Kotlin app that alows users to dymanically experiment with different colored backgrounds and buttons
### About this app
The purpose of this app is to accelerate my learning of Kotlin and the Android app development. This app illustrates:
 - The use of the ConstraintLayout view layout class
 - Adapdable constraints with weights biases
 - Fixed and relative constraints in the form of margins and relationships with parents / other views
 - Use of Ratios to preserve view shapes on any device
 - Chaining of aligned views
